# GPT Internals Demo

This demo trains a small character-level GPT in the browser using TensorFlow.js and visualises parts of the training process with tfjs-vis. You can:

- Load the Shakespeare corpus used by nanoGPT-style examples.
- Train a tiny transformer block and monitor loss/accuracy curves in the visor.
- Sample text with adjustable temperature and inspect the next-token distribution.
- Visualise the average attention map over the prompt tokens.
